# travel-app-repo

To install and run our prototype, the first step is to clone our repository. To view the prototype, your computer must have a javascript IDE installed, and you can use Visual Studio Code for the development. Your computer must also have react native installed to run our prototype. Additionally, you will need a mobile device with the Expo Go app installed, which can be downloaded through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The next step is to open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code. Currently, the updated program is in the development branchHowever. Following this, create a new terminal and make sure your directory is in the correct folder (StudyGuide). Next, type the command “npm install” to install the application and then type “npm start” to build and launch the application (just for the first time accessing it). The “npx expo start” command will create a QR code once the app has been build. Scan the QR code on the mobile device that has Expo Go installed, and the QR code will bring you to the mobile app.
